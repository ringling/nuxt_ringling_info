# About


Living north of Copenhagen with my wife and my daughter.

<br>

Lifetime learner and polyglot software craftsman with a great love for physical training,
music and nature.

<br>


A long experience implementing and teaching agile methodologies and principles.


<br>

With over 20 years of experience within software development, I span a variety of different
technologies, paradigms and programming languages.

<br>


I have had many roles within and outside IT, such as developer, coach, teacher, architect,
project manager, scrum master, product owner, team lead etc.

<br>


As I still do software development, I keep up with new technologies and hence thrive in
environments and cultures who value competences, innovation and creativity.
