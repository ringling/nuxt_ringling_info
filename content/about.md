# About


## Me
Lifetime learner and polyglot software craftsman with a great love for physical training,
music and nature.
<br>

Living north of Copenhagen with my wife and my daughter.
<br>

A long experience implementing and teaching agile methodologies and principles.
<br>

With over 20 years of experience within software development, I span a variety of different
technologies, paradigms and programming languages.
<br>

I have had many roles within and outside IT, such as developer, coach, teacher, architect,
project manager, scrum master, product owner, team lead etc.
<br>

As I still do software development, I keep up with new technologies and hence thrive in
environments and cultures who value competences, innovation and creativity.
